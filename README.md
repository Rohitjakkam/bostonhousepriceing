## Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about houses in Boston. The dataset includes the following features:
- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: Proportion of Black residents by town
- LSTAT: Lower status of the population (percent)
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

## Models
The following machine learning models were used:
- Linear Regression
